/**
 * pSOL v2 Encoding Verification Tests
 *
 * ⚠️ CRITICAL: These tests MUST pass before production deployment!
 *
 * This file verifies that encoding matches between:
 * - circomlib (off-chain Poseidon, Merkle trees)
 * - snarkjs (proof generation, VK export)
 * - Solana syscalls (BN254 pairing verification)
 * - On-chain Rust code
 *
 * Run with: npx ts-node tests/encoding-verification.ts
