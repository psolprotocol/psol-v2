# 🎉 STAGE A: E2E WITHDRAW FLOW - COMPLETE! 🎉

## Summary
Successfully completed the full deposit → settle → withdraw flow for pSOL v2 on Solana devnet.

## Transactions
1. **Deposit**: `4RvRzshgZwLDiTC1BY5JS5epqe6v7sqHoNKUSumcGDsBcjZ1d1S33J1jkzqHLWNZqcqVFkeLjksaJqwJY3iGCPY`
   - 0.1 SOL deposited into privacy pool
   - Commitment added to pending buffer

2. **Settlement**: `5HdQGw4hT9d3XGj3EkqgAh3dKCbTfMUeXfHdEYjFuKVmVmz9CU7T5YZzEHc7fVhD9xLDfNjhsK1H8NnUvmJfYTYS`
   - Batch of 2 deposits settled on-chain
   - Merkle tree updated with commitments

3. **Withdraw**: `2Ab58QpnDevtgriJoSng4UYP9XG1qp25QdjMYeHYMXu2SJxPNX3HdQNuzMeVEZi46JAozH4Ek33EQjvFaKwbSq7X`
   - ZK proof generated and verified ✅
   - 0.1 SOL withdrawn to recipient
   - Nullifier marked as spent

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. SDK Fixes
- Fixed deposit: ATA creation, SOL wrapping, proof serialization (Buffer.from)
- Fixed withdraw: Recipient & relayer ATA creation, proof serialization
- Pool authority fetched from on-chain state

### 2. Sequencer Configuration
- Updated all PDAs to match current devnet deployment
- Proper environment variable setup

### 3. ZK Proof Generation
- Correct leaf index verification from sequencer state
- Merkle tree rebuilt from commitments
- Nullifier hash: `Poseidon(Poseidon(nullifier, secret), leafIndex)`
- **Critical fix**: `publicDataHash` set to 0 (not computed) to match on-chain verifier

### 4. Byte Order (Endianness)
- **Big-endian** for all field elements (merkleRoot, nullifierHash, etc.)
- Matches BN254 convention and on-chain representation

### 5. Pool Registries
- Initialized `relayer_registry` and `compliance_config` PDAs
- Required for withdraw instruction execution

## Test Files
- `tests/test-withdraw-e2e-fixed.ts` - Working E2E test
- `tests/test-withdraw-note.json` - Note with verified leaf index
- `scripts/find-leaf-index.ts` - Leaf index verification
- `scripts/init-relayer-registry.ts` - Registry initialization

## Verification
- Transaction finalized on devnet ✅
- Recipient received 0.1 SOL ✅
- No double-spend (nullifier tracked) ✅
